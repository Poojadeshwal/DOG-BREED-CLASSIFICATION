# DOG-BREED-CLASSIFICATION
In this project, we will encounter a program that will help us to identify the resembling dog breed. We will be using some algorithm and trying to find the specific breed of the dog just by using a photo. It will work as the user will provide the photo of the dog and the machine will try finding special features of dog. Photo that was initial given by the user. And then the features taken up from the photo will be compared with the one in the database and the most resembling breed type will be out cased. Initially the dataset will be trained and tested and afterwards when we have maximum accuracy then we will execute the algorithm to its final stage.   The test accuracy target identifies the dog breed 9 times out of 10 correctly. To build this project we will use python, HTML, CSS, and ANN. For developing the front end, we will be using HTML AND JAVASCRIPT. And for backend purposes we will use python and CNN. CNN is one of the best technologies we have right now, we can use it for image recognition. in the proposed experiment we will be using more than 1000 human images and approximately 8000 dog images are taken into consideration. The accuracy metric on the testing dataset is used to measure the performance of our models.
